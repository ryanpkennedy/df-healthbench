Sample Medical Policy Documents for Providers

1. Telehealth Reimbursement Policy

Purpose: Outline how providers can bill and receive payment for telehealth services under current U.S. healthcare guidelines.

Key Points:

Coverage and Parity: Telehealth (including live video visits and asynchronous services) is generally covered by Medicare, Medicaid, and private payers, with many states requiring reimbursement at parity with in-person visits
telehealth.hhs.gov
. Providers should remain updated on state-specific parity laws and payer policies.

Eligible Services & Providers: The policy aligns with CMS guidelines on telehealth. Physicians, nurse practitioners, PAs, clinical psychologists, and other licensed practitioners are eligible to deliver telehealth services. Common eligible services include evaluation & management (E/M) visits, mental health counseling, and certain physical/occupational therapies. Example: Medicare allows any enrolled provider to bill for telehealth (during the COVID-19 PHE and beyond) regardless of patient or provider location
telehealth.hhs.gov
.

Coding and Billing Requirements: Providers must use appropriate CPT/HCPCS codes and modifiers for telehealth. Place of Service (POS) codes – e.g. POS 02 (telehealth provided other than patient’s home) or POS 10 (telehealth in patient’s home) – should be used on claims to indicate virtual services
emblemhealth.com
emblemhealth.com
. Many payers also require modifier 95 or GT on telehealth claims to denote synchronous video encounters. Documentation should reflect that the service was conducted via telemedicine.

Payment Rates: Under many parity laws, telehealth visits are reimbursed at the same rate as face-to-face visits
telehealth.hhs.gov
. For example, a follow-up consult via video is paid equivalent to an office visit of the same complexity. Providers should verify specific contracts, as some insurers may have exceptions (such as differing facility fees or technology-related codes).

Medicare and Medicaid Specifics: Medicare maintains a list of telehealth-approved services in its Physician Fee Schedule, updated annually
telehealth.hhs.gov
. During the PHE, Medicare lifted geographic restrictions, allowing urban telehealth and home as an originating site; some of these flexibilities have been extended or made permanent. Medicaid programs in all states reimburse live video telehealth, but coverage of audio-only, remote patient monitoring, or store-and-forward services varies by state
telehealth.hhs.gov
. Providers must consult state Medicaid guidelines for eligible telehealth modalities.

Compliance: Providers should obtain patient consent for telehealth if required by the payer, ensure HIPAA-compliant video platforms (or adhere to OCR flexibility rules if applicable), and document patient location, provider location, and technology used. Our policy requires periodic training for billing staff to keep current with telehealth billing rules. Claims will be monitored for appropriate use of codes and modifiers to prevent denials or audits.

2. Hospital Price Transparency and Billing Policy

Purpose: Ensure compliance with federal price transparency regulations and provide clear, standardized pricing and billing information for patients. This policy guides how the hospital sets procedure prices, communicates costs to patients, and handles billing.

Standard Charge Listing: In line with the CMS Hospital Price Transparency Final Rule (effective Jan 1, 2021), our hospital publishes a comprehensive machine-readable file of standard charges for all items and services
cms.gov
. This includes gross charges, discounted cash prices, and payer-specific negotiated rates for procedures, drugs, and facility fees. The file is updated at least annually and whenever significant price changes occur.

Shoppable Services in Consumer-Friendly Format: The hospital also provides an easily accessible list of at least 300 shoppable services (common electives and tests) with plain-language descriptions and prices
cms.gov
. Patients can access an online tool to obtain an estimate of their out-of-pocket cost for these services based on their insurance coverage or self-pay status. The goal is to help patients compare prices and anticipate costs before receiving care
cms.gov
.

Procedure Pricing Policy: All procedure charges are set through a transparent methodology considering hospital costs, market rates, and payer contract terms. For example: surgical procedure fees bundle typical related services (operating room, anesthesia, recovery) to the extent possible. The policy mandates that any mandatory facility fees (e.g. for outpatient clinics) are clearly disclosed to patients prior to service.

Patient Cost Estimates and Counseling: Prior to non-emergency, high-cost procedures, patients should receive a written Good Faith Estimate of charges. Financial counselors will help insured patients understand their deductible, co-pay, or coinsurance obligations, and uninsured or self-pay patients are informed of our discount and charity care policies. For insured patients, staff use insurance verification tools to calculate an estimate of the allowable charge and the patient’s share.

Billing Statements and Clarity: Patient bills are designed to be clear and itemized. They separate charges by service date and type, list insurance payments, adjustments, and patient responsibility. The billing office must include contact information on statements and offer support for patients to ask questions or dispute charges.

Financial Assistance and Eligibility: As part of pricing policy, the hospital prominently advertises its Financial Assistance Program. Patients under a certain income threshold or with financial hardship can apply for charity care or sliding-scale discounts. Eligibility criteria (such as household income <200% of federal poverty level for charity care) are published on our website and in patient admission packets. Billing staff are trained to screen patients for eligibility and proactively offer applications to those who qualify.

Compliance and Penalties: The hospital’s Revenue Cycle Committee reviews pricing files quarterly to ensure compliance. Monitoring: CMS may audit the website; noncompliance can lead to corrective action requests or civil monetary penalties
cms.gov
. This policy requires immediate remediation of any identified transparency issues to avoid fines and, importantly, to uphold trust with our patients.

3. Patient Eligibility and Preauthorization Policy

Purpose: Define procedures for verifying patient insurance eligibility, benefits coverage, and obtaining necessary preauthorizations before services, to ensure reimbursement and minimize denials. This policy applies to all scheduled admissions, outpatient procedures, and any non-emergent services.

Insurance Verification: The front-office staff (or designated billing personnel) must verify the patient’s insurance coverage prior to the appointment or procedure. Key information to confirm includes: the plan’s active status, patient’s policy number and demographics, co-payment or coinsurance, remaining deductible, out-of-pocket maximum, and any benefit limits or caps
webpt.com
. Staff should also confirm where to send claims and if special claim forms or referrals are required by the payer
webpt.com
. This comprehensive eligibility check is critical – it is the first and most important step in the billing cycle, as missing information can render a claim “dead in the water”
webpt.com
.

Preauthorization Requirements: For services that require prior authorization or referral (e.g. imaging like MRI, specialist consults, elective surgeries), staff must contact the insurer well in advance. Using insurer portals or phone, they will submit necessary clinical information to obtain an authorization number. The authorization (or referral) number should be documented in the patient’s record and included on the claim. If retroactive authorization is possible (some payers allow post-service auth in urgent cases), the staff should still attempt it, but the policy is to secure auth before service whenever required, as many payers will deny payment if this step is missed
webpt.com
.

Timing: Ideally, initial eligibility checks for scheduled services occur 3–5 days before the appointment. The policy suggests a 72-hour re-verification window – meaning benefits should be re-checked within 72 hours prior to the service date to catch any last-minute changes
webpt.com
(e.g., patient changed jobs/insurance, new month’s deductible reset). For recurring visits, verify coverage at least monthly.

Patient Communication: If verification reveals issues (coverage lapsed, service not covered, high patient financial responsibility), staff must promptly inform the patient. Patients with no active insurance are offered financial counseling for self-pay arrangements or charity care as appropriate. If a required preauth is denied or pending, the patient and ordering provider are notified, and the procedure may need to be rescheduled or peer-to-peer insurer review may be pursued.

Documentation: All eligibility and authorization details are recorded in the practice management system. This includes reference numbers from phone calls or portal transactions, names of reps spoken to, dates, and outcomes. Keeping this documentation helps if there are payer disputes later.

Day-of-Service Checks: On the day of service (especially for walk-in or same-day add-on patients), front desk should perform a quick real-time eligibility check via our electronic system. They will also scan insurance ID cards for any changes and have the patient update any registration info. If any discrepancy or lapse is found, the department supervisor must decide whether to proceed or defer the service.

Training and Quality: Front-office and billing staff receive training on using our electronic eligibility tools and understanding insurance terminology. Periodic audits are conducted: e.g., verifying a random sample of encounters to ensure eligibility was properly checked and documented. The billing manager will track denials due to “no eligibility” or “no authorization” – our goal is to minimize these by strict adherence to this policy.

By rigorously verifying coverage and requirements upfront, the practice reduces claim denials, speeds up reimbursement, and provides transparency to patients about their coverage and financial responsibility.

4. Hypertension Management Clinical Guideline

Purpose: Provide evidence-based guidance for screening, diagnosis, and management of hypertension (high blood pressure) in adults, in line with current American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) guidelines
acc.org
acc.org
. This clinical policy is intended for use by providers in primary care and applicable specialties.

Blood Pressure Classification: We adopt the 2017 ACC/AHA criteria for BP categories
acc.org
:

Normal: <120/<80 mm Hg

Elevated: 120-129/<80 mm Hg

Hypertension Stage 1: 130-139 or 80-89 mm Hg

Hypertension Stage 2: ≥140 or ≥90 mm Hg (either systolic or diastolic).
A diagnosis of hypertension is confirmed if elevated readings are noted on 2 or more occasions (after an initial screening) unless the initial BP is extremely high or presenting with hypertensive emergency. Out-of-office measurements (home BP or 24h ambulatory BP monitoring) are recommended to rule out white-coat effect and confirm the diagnosis
acc.org
.

Cardiovascular Risk Assessment: For all hypertensive patients, assess other CVD risk factors such as smoking, diabetes, dyslipidemia, chronic kidney disease, family history, etc. Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) 10-year risk calculation is advised, as it guides treatment thresholds. Patients with hypertension should also have baseline tests (e.g. fasting glucose, lipid panel, creatinine, TSH, ECG, and urine albumin if diabetes or CKD) to screen for causes and end-organ effects
acc.org
.

Non-Pharmacologic Management: Emphasize lifestyle interventions for all patients with elevated BP or hypertension. Recommended changes (with expected SBP reduction in parentheses) include:

Weight loss if overweight (5-20 mm Hg per 10 kg lost),

Heart-healthy diet such as the DASH diet (up to ~11 mm Hg decrease)
acc.org
,

Reduced sodium intake (<1500 mg/day ideally),

Enhanced dietary potassium intake (e.g. fruits, vegetables) unless contraindicated,

Regular aerobic exercise (~4-8 mm Hg decrease),

Moderation of alcohol (≤2 drinks/day men, ≤1 drink/day women).
These lifestyle modifications can produce a 4-5 mm Hg average reduction in SBP (even higher with combination of diet and weight loss)
acc.org
and should be initiated in all patients, including those who will also require medications.

When to Initiate Medication: Our guideline mirrors ACC/AHA recommendations for thresholds:

If average BP is ≥140/90 mm Hg in a patient without additional risk factors (ASCVD risk <10%), start pharmacotherapy (after confirming with repeat readings).

If BP is ≥130/80 mm Hg in a patient who has clinical CVD or 10-year ASCVD risk ≥10%, or for patients with diabetes, CKD, or other high-risk conditions, initiate pharmacologic treatment
acc.org
acc.org
. (In other words, Stage 1 hypertension with high risk warrants meds; Stage 1 with low risk can do 3-6 months lifestyle first
acc.org
).

Patients with Stage 2 hypertension (≥140/90) generally require medications regardless of calculated risk.

BP Treatment Goals: The target blood pressure for most non-pregnant adults with hypertension is <130/80 mm Hg
acc.org
. This target is recommended for patients with established cardiovascular disease or high risk, and is considered reasonable for lower-risk hypertensives as well, as long as therapy is well-tolerated
acc.org
. We individualize goals for older patients (e.g., ≥65 years, especially if frail or multiple comorbidities) – aiming for <130 SBP is appropriate for healthy older adults, but some may have a less stringent goal (e.g. <140/90) based on tolerance and clinical judgment.

First-line Medications: Initial pharmacologic therapy for most adults is one of the four first-line classes, unless specific comorbid indications:

Thiazide diuretics (e.g. hydrochlorothiazide, chlorthalidone),

ACE Inhibitors (e.g. lisinopril, enalapril) or ARBs (losartan, valsartan),

Calcium Channel Blockers (CCBs) (e.g. amlodipine, diltiazem).
Beta-blockers are not first-line in uncomplicated hypertension (reserved for post-MI, heart failure, or atrial fibrillation situations)
acc.org
acc.org
. For African American patients without CKD, thiazides or CCBs are particularly effective as initial choices
acc.org
acc.org
. In Stage 1 hypertension, start with a single drug; in Stage 2 (average BP ≥20/10 mm Hg above goal), consider starting two agents from different classes for better control
acc.org
.

Titration and Follow-up: After initiating therapy, follow up in about 1 month to reassess BP. Titrate the dose or add a second medication if the goal is not met. Emphasize medication adherence and address any side effects. Once at goal, follow-up visits can be 3-6 months apart (more often if other comorbidities).

Special Situations:

Patients with diabetes and hypertension should ideally be treated to <130/80, and ACEi/ARB are favored if albuminuria is present
acc.org
acc.org
.

CKD stage ≥3 or stage 1-2 with proteinuria: include an ACE inhibitor (or ARB if ACEi not tolerated) for renal protection
acc.org
.

Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction: beta-blockers and ACEi/ARBs are indicated; avoid non-dihydropyridine CCBs in HFrEF.

Pregnancy: ACEi, ARB (and renin inhibitors) are contraindicated – use labetalol, nifedipine, or methyldopa instead.

Resistant hypertension (uncontrolled on 3 drugs): consider aldosterone antagonist (spironolactone), evaluate adherence, and screen for secondary causes (e.g., primary aldosteronism, renal artery stenosis, OSA).

Monitoring: Once BP is at target, patients should still have at least annual in-office BP checks (more frequent if adjusting meds). Home BP monitoring is encouraged to assist with titration and to ensure control outside the clinic (patients are educated on proper technique). Labs (electrolytes, kidney function) should be checked periodically, especially for those on diuretics, ACEi, or ARBs.

By following this guideline, providers will effectively reduce patients’ risk of strokes, myocardial infarctions, heart failure, and other complications of hypertension through timely treatment and control of blood pressure

5. Type 2 Diabetes Management Clinical Guideline

Purpose: Provide a comprehensive overview of current best practices for screening, diagnosing, and managing type 2 diabetes mellitus in adults, based on the American Diabetes Association (ADA) Standards of Medical Care (2024) and other consensus guidelines.

Screening and Diagnosis: Adults ≥35 years old should be screened for diabetes at least every 3 years, or earlier/frequently if overweight (BMI ≥25, or ≥23 in Asian Americans) with additional risk factors (e.g., family history, hypertension, dyslipidemia, history of gestational diabetes). Diagnosis is confirmed if any of the following criteria are met (on two separate tests or the same test repeated)
diabetes.org
:

Hemoglobin A1c ≥ 6.5% (in a lab standardized to DCCT assay)
diabetes.org
,

Fasting Plasma Glucose ≥ 126 mg/dL (after ≥8-hour fast),

2-hour Plasma Glucose ≥ 200 mg/dL during an oral glucose tolerance test (75g OGTT),

Random Plasma Glucose ≥ 200 mg/dL with classic symptoms of hyperglycemia (polyuria, polydipsia, unexplained weight loss)
aafp.org
.

Prediabetes is defined as A1c 5.7–6.4%, Fasting glucose 100–125 mg/dL, or 2-hr OGTT 140–199 mg/dL
aafp.org
. Patients with prediabetes should receive counseling on weight loss (≥7% body weight) and exercise to prevent progression, and metformin can be considered especially if BMI ≥35, age <60, or history of gestational diabetes.

Glycemic Targets: For most nonpregnant adults with diabetes, the A1c goal is <7% (which corresponds roughly to an average glucose <154 mg/dL)
diabetes.org
. This target has been shown to reduce microvascular complications. However, targets are individualized based on patient factors:

A stricter goal (A1c <6.5%) may be appropriate for younger patients with short disease duration, no significant hypoglycemia, and no comorbidities, if achievable without undue risk
diabetes.org
.

A looser goal (A1c <8% or even slightly higher) may be appropriate for patients who are older, have a history of severe hypoglycemia, limited life expectancy, or multiple coexisting chronic illnesses, where the risks of tight control outweigh benefits
diabetes.org
.

In all cases, avoidance of severe hypoglycemia is paramount. Fingerstick or continuous glucose monitoring is used to guide therapy adjustments especially if aiming for near-normal A1c.

Lifestyle Management: Lifestyle modification is the foundation of diabetes management:

Medical Nutrition Therapy: Emphasize a balanced diet with portion control, focusing on vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats. There is no one-size diet; any eating pattern (Mediterranean, low-carb, plant-based, DASH, etc.) that achieves weight loss and improved glucose is encouraged. Advise limiting refined carbs and sugary beverages.

Weight Management: For overweight or obese patients, a weight loss of 5-10% significantly improves glycemic control. Integrate weight loss strategies (diet changes, increased physical activity, and possibly weight management medications or bariatric surgery evaluation if indicated).

Physical Activity: Recommend at least 150 minutes/week of moderate-intensity exercise (such as brisk walking), spread over at least 3 days, plus resistance training 2-3 times/week. Breaking up sedentary time is also advised (light activity every 30 minutes).

Diabetes Self-Management Education (DSME): Ensure patients receive education on carbohydrate counting or general meal planning, blood glucose monitoring technique, foot care, and recognition of hypo/hyperglycemia symptoms. This improves compliance and outcomes
aafp.org
.

Pharmacologic Therapy Initiation: Metformin is the first-line medication for type 2 diabetes in nearly all cases (unless contraindicated due to renal insufficiency or intolerance)
ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. Start metformin at a low dose (e.g., 500 mg daily or BID) and titrate to the effective dose (~2000 mg/day as tolerated) over a few weeks to minimize GI side effects. Metformin is weight-neutral or modestly weight-losing, does not cause hypoglycemia, and has strong evidence for reducing diabetes complications
ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
.

At diagnosis, if A1c is <9%, start metformin monotherapy
ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
alongside lifestyle measures.

If A1c is ≥9% at diagnosis, consider initial dual therapy (metformin + another agent) because monotherapy is less likely to achieve goal
ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
.

If A1c ≥10% or patient has markedly symptomatic hyperglycemia (e.g., weight loss, polyuria, ketonuria), consider initiating insulin along with oral agents, as glucotoxicity may be present.

Add-on Therapy: If the A1c target is not achieved with metformin and lifestyle, or if patient has established cardiovascular or kidney disease, add a second-line agent guided by comorbidities:

For patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) (e.g., prior heart attack, stroke) or high ASCVD risk, consider a GLP-1 receptor agonist (like liraglutide, semaglutide) or an SGLT2 inhibitor (like empagliflozin, canagliflozin) with proven cardiovascular benefit. These have been shown to reduce CV events. GLP-1 RAs also aid weight loss; SGLT2 inhibitors have diuretic effect and also reduce heart failure risk.

For patients with heart failure (HFrEF) or chronic kidney disease, favor an SGLT2 inhibitor (if eGFR above threshold) because of benefits in reducing heart failure hospitalization and slowing CKD progression. Some GLP-1 RAs can be used if SGLT2i not tolerated or contraindicated.

If no ASCVD/HF/CKD predominates and need to minimize weight gain, a GLP-1 RA or SGLT2i is preferred (both are weight-lowering). If cost is a major issue or these aren’t options, other classes include DPP-4 inhibitors (weight-neutral, but modest effect) or sulfonylureas (effective, inexpensive but can cause hypoglycemia and weight gain).

Insulin: Eventually, many patients will require insulin for optimal control, especially if beta-cell function declines. Long-acting basal insulin can be added if oral/GLP-1 meds are insufficient (particularly if A1c is very high or catabolic features present). Titrate basal insulin to achieve fasting glucose ~80-130 mg/dL. Prandial (mealtime) insulin may be added later if needed.

Blood Pressure and Lipid Management: Treating co-morbid hypertension and dyslipidemia is integral to diabetes care. Aim for BP <130/80 for most diabetics
diabetes.org
, and use ACEi/ARB preferentially for renal protection. Statin therapy is indicated for virtually all diabetic patients ≥40 years (moderate-intensity statin, or high-intensity if multiple risk factors or existing CVD) to reduce CV risk.

Monitoring and Follow-Up:

A1c testing every ~3 months if not at goal or if adjusting therapy, and every 6 months if stable at goal.

Home glucose monitoring: For patients on agents that can cause hypoglycemia (insulin or sulfonylureas), encourage regular self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG). For others, individualized SMBG may help guide lifestyle and medication adjustments.

Annual assessments for diabetes complications: dilated eye exam for retinopathy
aafp.org
, comprehensive foot exam, urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio for nephropathy, and neuropathy screening (monofilament test).

Immunizations: Ensure patients receive recommended vaccines (influenza annually, pneumococcal vaccines, hepatitis B, etc. as per CDC guidelines).

Patient Education and Support: Encourage participation in diabetes education programs and consider nutritional counseling. Address psychosocial issues (diabetes distress, depression) as they can impact self-care.

By adhering to this guideline, providers will help patients achieve glycemic control (A1c <7% for many)
diabetes.org
, minimize diabetes-related complications, and improve overall quality of life. Care is patient-centered: therapy intensification is balanced against safety and patient preferences, with a goal of empowering patients in self-management.

6. Sepsis Early Management Protocol

Purpose: Establish a standardized, evidence-based approach for the rapid recognition and treatment of sepsis and septic shock. This protocol is based on the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines and is intended to guide emergency department and inpatient clinical staff in delivering the “sepsis bundle” of care
aafp.org
aafp.org
.

Recognition and Activation:

Screening: Nurses and providers should be vigilant for signs of sepsis in any patient with infection. Warning criteria include: temperature >38.3°C or <36°C, heart rate >90, respiratory rate >20, altered mental status, significant edema or positive fluid balance, high lactate, or low blood pressure. Use of an early warning score (e.g., Modified Early Warning Score – MEWS) or SIRS criteria is encouraged, as they are more sensitive than qSOFA for detecting patients at risk
aafp.org
aafp.org
.

Sepsis Alerts: If sepsis is suspected (infection + signs of organ dysfunction such as hypotension, hypoxia, oliguria, lactate >2), trigger a sepsis alert/page the sepsis response team. Time zero is when sepsis is recognized – rapid response is critical.

Initial Management Bundle (First 1-3 Hours): Our hospital follows a sepsis bundle akin to the “Hour-1 bundle” for septic shock:

Measure Lactate Level: Draw serum lactate immediately. Lactate helps gauge severity (≥4 mmol/L is worrisome for septic shock)
aafp.org
. Repeat lactate in 2-4 hours if initial is elevated (>2) to guide resuscitation.

Obtain Cultures: Before starting antibiotics, obtain blood cultures x2 (from two different sites) and any relevant cultures (urine, sputum, wound) as indicated
aafp.org
. However, do not delay antibiotics significantly for cultures – if obtaining cultures causes >45 minute delay, prioritize antibiotics.

Broad-Spectrum Antibiotics: Administer IV antimicrobials promptly. For septic shock (hypotension or lactate ≥4), give antibiotics within 1 hour
aafp.org
aafp.org
. For sepsis without shock, goal is within 3 hours
aafp.org
aafp.org
. Choose broad-spectrum coverage targeting likely sources (e.g., ceftriaxone + azithromycin for possible pneumonia, or piperacillin-tazobactam for intra-abdominal sepsis), and include MRSA coverage (vancomycin) or fungal coverage if risk factors present
aafp.org
. Document time of antibiotic administration.

Fluid Resuscitation: If the patient is hypotensive (MAP <65) or lactate ≥4, begin rapid infusion of IV crystalloid fluids. Give an initial bolus of 30 mL/kg (about 2-3 liters in an average adult) as quickly as possible, ideally within the first 3 hours
aafp.org
. Use balanced crystalloids (e.g., Lactated Ringer’s) over normal saline when available, due to some evidence of improved outcomes
aafp.org
. Monitor for response (improvements in BP, urine output, mentation) and signs of fluid overload.

Oxygen & Monitoring: Provide supplemental O₂ to maintain SpO₂ ≥94% (or ≥90% in COPD). Place the patient on continuous monitoring (cardiac monitor, pulse oximetry) and measure frequent vital signs. Insert at least two large-bore IVs; consider central line and arterial line if needed for vasopressors or invasive monitoring.

Advanced Management (Within 6 Hours):

Vasopressors: If after fluids the patient remains hypotensive (MAP <65), start vasopressors. Norepinephrine is the first-line vasopressor
aafp.org
aafp.org
. Titrate norepinephrine to achieve MAP ≥65. If additional support needed, vasopressin can be added (0.03 U/min) and/or epinephrine. Aim to initiate vasopressors via central line, but do NOT delay – they can be started peripherally if central access is not yet available
aafp.org
. Monitor blood pressure closely (arterial line placement is recommended in shock for continuous BP monitoring
aafp.org
).

Reassessment: Within a few hours of initial resuscitation, reassess volume status and tissue perfusion. This includes focused exam (vitals, cardiopulmonary, capillary refill, skin perfusion) and/or hemodynamic measures. Bedside ultrasound or passive leg raise tests can guide if more fluid may help. If lactate was elevated, redraw it – a decreasing lactate is a good sign of improving perfusion
aafp.org
.

Urine Output: Place Foley catheter to monitor urine output; aim for ≥0.5 mL/kg/hr as a perfusion target.

Source Control: Investigate and address the infection source. This could mean draining an abscess, removing infected devices/lines, surgery consultation for necrotic tissue or intra-abdominal source, etc. Effective source control (e.g., surgical debridement or catheter removal) should occur as soon as possible, ideally within 12 hours of diagnosis
aafp.org
aafp.org
.

Respiratory Support: If the patient develops respiratory failure (e.g., ARDS from sepsis), apply appropriate ventilatory support. High-flow nasal cannula can be used in sepsis-induced hypoxemic respiratory failure to stave off intubation
aafp.org
. If intubation is required, use lung-protective ventilation (tidal volume ~6 mL/kg IBW) as per ARDSnet protocol.

Monitoring and Ongoing Care:

ICU Admission: All patients with septic shock or severe sepsis with organ failure should be managed in ICU if beds available. Time to ICU transfer should be within 6 hours of presentation (delays beyond 6h are associated with higher mortality)
aafp.org
.

Additional Therapy: If hypotension is refractory, consider hydrocortisone IV (200 mg/day) for possible relative adrenal insufficiency. In select cases, when large volumes are needed, use albumin after substantial crystalloids
aafp.org
. Blood transfusion is indicated if hemoglobin <7.0 (unless active bleeding). Manage blood glucose (target <180 mg/dL). Initiate DVT and stress ulcer prophylaxis as appropriate.

Team and Communication: Activate the sepsis response team (which may include critical care, infectious disease, pharmacy, and nursing leadership). Nursing will document sepsis bundle elements completion times. Families should be updated regarding the patient’s critical status and ongoing treatment.

This protocol ensures that the “golden hours” of sepsis are utilized to deliver life-saving interventions promptly. By following the bundle – early antibiotics, fluids, and supportive care – the hospital has observed improved patient outcomes and reduced sepsis mortality
aafp.org
aafp.org
. Continuous quality improvement (through sepsis code reviews and compliance tracking) is ongoing to maintain excellence in sepsis management.

7. Acute Ischemic Stroke Protocol

Purpose: Outline the acute management steps for patients presenting with acute ischemic stroke, to maximize the chances of neurological recovery. This protocol aligns with American Stroke Association (ASA) guidelines for early stroke management
acc.org
acc.org
and is intended for use in the Emergency Department and inpatient stroke teams.

Immediate Response – “Code Stroke”:

Activation: If a patient presents with stroke symptoms (sudden weakness, facial droop, speech difficulty, etc., often identified via FAST criteria) or if an in-patient has a new acute neurological deficit, call a Code Stroke overhead and notify the stroke team immediately. Time of symptom onset (or last known well time) must be ascertained and communicated, as it guides therapy eligibility
acc.org
.

Initial Assessments (within minutes): Perform ABCs (Airway, Breathing, Circulation); give oxygen if needed to keep O₂ sat >94%. Check blood glucose (treat hypoglycemia, since it can mimic stroke). Obtain IV access x2, and send STAT labs including CBC, BMP, coagulation panel.

Imaging: Immediate non-contrast head CT (or brain MRI if CT not available) is priority – target within 20 minutes of arrival for potential stroke patients
acc.org
. This is to rule out hemorrhagic stroke and assess for early signs of infarct. The CT should be read by a physician (or teleradiology) promptly. Do not delay CT for labs (except point-of-care glucose) – imaging comes first. If large vessel occlusion stroke is suspected (high NIHSS score, cortical signs), also obtain CT Angiography of head and neck at the same time as the initial CT, as long as it doesn’t delay IV tPA administration
acc.org
.

IV Thrombolytic Therapy (tPA):

Inclusion Criteria: If CT confirms no intracerebral hemorrhage and patient is within the treatment window, evaluate for IV alteplase (tPA). Standard inclusion: measurable neurologic deficit, onset of symptoms <3 hours ago
acc.org
. On a case-by-case basis, patients can be treated in the extended window 3–4.5 hours from onset, provided they meet extended criteria (age <80, not on anticoagulants, NIHSS <25, not a diabetic with prior stroke, etc.)
acc.org
.

Contraindications: Recent major surgery, GI bleed, or stroke within 3 months; severe uncontrolled hypertension (>185/110 mmHg at time of treatment – this must be lowered below 185/110 before tPA)
acc.org
; platelet count <100k, INR >1.7 or on DOACs, etc. Use the institutional tPA checklist.

Dosing and Administration: If no contraindications, obtain verbal consent if possible and administer IV tPA at 0.9 mg/kg (max 90 mg) over 60 minutes (10% given as initial bolus). Document the time bolus given – this is the “door-to-needle time” which we aim to keep <60 minutes
acc.org
for at least half of eligible patients. During and after tPA, closely monitor BP (keep <180/105)
acc.org
and neuro status. No antiplatelets or anticoagulants for 24 hours after tPA.

If tPA is not given: (either outside window or contraindicated), proceed with other aspects of care; consider if patient might be a candidate for thrombectomy (see below) or if not, then aspirin.

Mechanical Thrombectomy (MT):

Identify LVO: If CTA (or MRA) shows a large vessel occlusion (LVO) in anterior circulation (ICA or proximal MCA), the patient may benefit from endovascular thrombectomy. Our protocol follows 2018 AHA guidelines:

Up to 6 hours from onset: Patients with LVO, NIHSS ≥6, and small infarct core (e.g., ASPECTS ≥6 on CT) should be immediately considered for thrombectomy
acc.org
. Activate on-call interventional neuroradiology (stroke intervention team) while patient is still getting IV tPA (tPA and thrombectomy are complementary if within 0–3h window).

6–24 hours from onset: Some patients may still be eligible based on advanced imaging (perfusion scans). If the patient’s last known well is beyond 6 hours (e.g., wake-up stroke, or discovered stroke), obtain CT perfusion or MRI DWI/FLAIR mismatch. If criteria from DAWN or DEFUSE 3 trials are met (e.g., clinical deficit out of proportion to infarct core size), thrombectomy can be done up to 16 hours, and in select cases up to 24 hours after last known well
acc.org
acc.org
.

Process: Rapidly discuss case with stroke neurologist and neuro-interventionalist. If criteria met, transfer the patient to the cath lab as soon as possible. Aim for puncture time within 90 minutes of decision. Continue supportive care, blood pressure management (for an LVO not treated with tPA, permissive hypertension up to BP 210/110 is allowed until recanalization, or <185/110 if tPA was given).

Supportive Acute Care:

Blood Pressure Management: If giving tPA, blood pressure must be <185/110 before and <180/105 after administration
acc.org
(use IV labetalol or nicardipine drip for control). If no tPA or post-thrombectomy, generally avoid acute lowering unless BP >220/120 or other end-organ issue.

Aspirin: Give aspirin 325 mg within 24-48 hours after stroke onset in most patients
acc.org
. Note: If tPA was given, aspirin (or any anticoagulant) is delayed until 24 hours later and after a follow-up CT confirms no hemorrhage
acc.org
.

Head Elevation & Fever: Keep head of bed at 15-30 degrees (flat if tolerated, to improve cerebral perfusion, unless concern for aspiration). Treat fever >38°C (antipyretics) and treat hyperglycemia – keep glucose 140-180 mg/dL in acute phase (as both fever and high glucose worsen outcomes).

Swallow Evaluation: NPO until a swallow screen is performed to reduce aspiration risk.

Monitoring: Admit patient to Stroke Unit or ICU. Neurologic checks and blood pressure monitoring q15min initially (especially if tPA given). Watch for signs of neurological worsening (could indicate hemorrhagic transformation or edema – if so, obtain stat CT).

Post-Acute Management:

After the acute interventions, initiate workup for stroke etiology (imaging of carotids, cardiac monitoring for A-fib, echocardiogram, lab tests for risk factors). Start secondary prevention measures: high-intensity statin, antithrombotic therapy (antiplatelet for non-cardioembolic strokes, or anticoagulation if A-fib detected – timing of start to be determined by stroke team, usually after a few days).

Engage rehab services early (physical, occupational, speech therapy) once the patient is stable – the stroke unit with multidisciplinary rehab has been shown to improve outcomes
acc.org
.

Provide patient/family education on stroke warning signs, the importance of risk factor control, and follow-up plans (neurology, primary care).

By adhering to these time-sensitive steps – rapid imaging, prompt IV thrombolysis within 3-4.5 hours for eligible patients
acc.org
, and expeditious mechanical thrombectomy for large vessel occlusions
acc.org
– this protocol aims to reduce stroke-related disability. The stroke team will review all “code stroke” cases in quality meetings to continually improve door-to-needle and door-to-puncture times and overall care quality.

8. Opioid Prescribing and Pain Management Policy

Purpose: Provide safe prescribing guidelines for opioids in the management of pain, to optimize patient outcomes and minimize risks such as addiction, overdose, and diversion. This policy reflects the CDC’s 2022 Opioid Prescribing Guideline and is intended for all prescribers in our facility
aafp.org
aafp.org
. It focuses on chronic non-cancer pain in adults (acute pain and cancer/palliative pain are addressed separately).

General Principles:

Alternatives First: Prioritize nonpharmacologic therapies (e.g., physical therapy, exercise, cognitive behavioral therapy) and non-opioid medications (NSAIDs, acetaminophen, anticonvulsants, SNRIs, etc.) for pain management
aafp.org
. Opioids should be reserved for pain that has not responded to these treatments and when expected benefits outweigh risks.

Before Starting Opioids: Establish realistic treatment goals for pain and function with the patient (e.g., improved ability to perform daily activities)
aafp.org
. Opioids are a trial – continue only if there is clear improvement in pain and function ≥30% with opioid therapy that outweighs risks. If such improvement does not occur, opioids should be tapered and discontinued
aafp.org
.

Informed Consent and Risk Discussion: Discuss the known risks of opioid therapy (sedation, respiratory depression, addiction, physical dependence, constipation, etc.) and responsibilities (safe storage, not sharing medication). Have patients sign a pain management agreement if chronic opioids are prescribed, outlining one prescriber, one pharmacy, etc.

Opioid Initiation and Dosing:

Lowest Effective Dose: When starting opioids (especially in opioid-naïve patients), use the lowest effective dosage of an immediate-release opioid; avoid initiating long-acting opioids for acute or opioid-naïve patients
aafp.org
. A short duration (see acute pain section) is usually sufficient for acute pain.

Avoid High Dosages: Use particular caution when increasing dosage. Reassess benefits/risks before increasing to ≥50 morphine milligram equivalents (MME) per day, and avoid or carefully justify any dose ≥90 MME/day
aafp.org
. (For reference, 90 MME/day is about 60 mg oxycodone total per day or 20 mg hydromorphone total per day.) Doses above this substantially increase overdose risk
aafp.org
.

Long-Acting/ER Opioids: Reserve extended-release/long-acting opioids for severe, continuous pain in opioid-tolerant patients. Do not use transdermal fentanyl or ER opioids for acute pain or initially; they can be considered only in established patients who need around-the-clock dosing.

Acute Pain Prescribing:

For acute pain (e.g., post-surgery or injury), if opioids are needed, prescribe the lowest effective dose of immediate-release opioids for no longer than the expected severe pain duration
aafp.org
. Often ≤3 days is sufficient; >7 days is rarely necessary. Avoid automatic refills. Reevaluate the patient if pain continues beyond the initial prescription rather than just extending opioid use.

Follow-Up and Monitoring:

Frequent Reassessment: If opioids are initiated for chronic pain, evaluate the patient within 1–4 weeks of starting or dose escalation
aafp.org
. At this follow-up, assess improvement in pain, function, and any signs of harm (sedation, overdose, misuse). Continued Therapy: For stable patients, re-evaluate at least every 3 months (more frequently if dose >50 MME or other risk factors)
aafp.org
. At each visit, determine whether opioids are still needed. If benefits do not clearly outweigh harms, taper and discontinue opioids gradually
aafp.org
.

Tapering: If stopping opioids, a gradual taper (e.g., reduce 5-10% of dose per month) is preferred to minimize withdrawal, unless an urgent safety concern requires faster taper. Coordinate taper plans with patient input, and provide psychosocial support or medication for withdrawal symptoms if needed.

Risk Mitigation Strategies:

Risk Screening: Prior to and during opioid therapy, evaluate risk factors for opioid misuse or overdose (history of substance use disorder, mental health conditions, concurrent benzodiazepine use, etc.)
aafp.org
. Consider offering naloxone to patients at higher risk (history of overdose, doses ≥50 MME, concurrent sedatives) as a precaution
aafp.org
.

Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP): Check the state PDMP database before starting opioids and periodically (at least every 3 months) during therapy
aafp.org
. This helps identify undisclosed opioid prescriptions or controlled substance use that could signal misuse or risk.

Urine Drug Testing: Obtain a baseline urine drug screen before initiating long-term opioid therapy, and perform periodic urine drug tests at least annually (or more often for higher risk patients)
aafp.org
. This checks for the presence of prescribed medications and absence of non-prescribed/illicit drugs. Explain to patients that this is a safety measure, not an implication of distrust.

Avoid Co-Prescribing Sedatives: Do not prescribe benzodiazepines concurrently with opioids whenever possible
aafp.org
. If a patient is on a benzodiazepine (e.g., for anxiety or insomnia), assess if it’s truly needed or if it can be tapered. The combination greatly increases overdose risk. Other CNS depressants (muscle relaxants, sleep aids) should also be limited.

Naloxone Rescue: Offer naloxone (an opioid overdose antidote) to patients with elevated risk: those on higher doses (≥50 MME), those with any opioid use disorder history, or concurrent benzo use
aafp.org
. Also consider for patients with respiratory conditions (like COPD) or if someone in the household could access the opioids. Provide education to patient and family on how and when to use naloxone.

Opioid Use Disorder (OUD): If there are signs of opioid misuse or addiction (e.g., difficulty controlling use, compulsive use, continued use despite harm), or if a patient admits to struggling, do not abruptly discharge the patient. Instead, address it as a health issue: arrange an evaluation for OUD and facilitate access to treatment (such as Medication-Assisted Treatment with buprenorphine or methadone, and counseling)
aafp.org
. Our providers include waivered prescribers who can initiate buprenorphine when appropriate, or we can refer to addiction specialists. Managing pain in patients with OUD often requires a collaborative approach with addiction medicine.

Documentation: Every opioid prescription (especially for chronic use) must be accompanied by clear chart documentation of the pain assessment, treatment plan, informed consent, goals, and follow-up plan. Document PDMP checks and urine drug test results. If deviations from this policy occur (e.g., co-prescribing a benzo due to psychiatric comorbidity, or prescribing above 90 MME), include a rationale in the notes.

By following this policy, providers will improve the safety of pain management. The focus is on effective pain control while minimizing the potential for opioid-related harm, aligning with national guidelines for responsible opioid prescribing

9. Infection Control and Hand Hygiene Policy

Purpose: Prevent healthcare-associated infections by enforcing rigorous hand hygiene and standard infection control practices among all staff. This policy is based on CDC infection control guidelines and applies to all healthcare workers (clinical and non-clinical) in the facility.

Hand Hygiene:

When to Clean Hands: All personnel must perform hand hygiene before and after touching a patient, before aseptic tasks, after contact with bodily fluids or contaminated surfaces, and immediately after glove removal
cdc.gov
. Essentially, if you think “should I clean my hands?”, the answer is yes. The CDC notes that healthcare workers may need to clean their hands as often as 100 times per shift to properly protect patients and themselves
cdc.gov
.

Method: Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer (at least 60% alcohol) as the preferred method for decontaminating hands in clinical situations, as long as hands are not visibly soiled
cdc.gov
. Hand sanitizer is more effective and less irritating than soap and water in most cases
cdc.gov
. Exceptions: Wash with soap and water if hands are visibly dirty, after caring for patients with C. difficile or norovirus (spore-forming organisms), after using the restroom, and before eating
cdc.gov
. Wash for at least 15-20 seconds, covering all hand surfaces (or use the hospital’s automated scrub timers where available).

Nails & Skin: Keep natural nails short (<¼ inch). Artificial nails or extensions are prohibited for staff with direct patient contact (they harbor microbes). Use hospital-approved hand lotions to prevent skin dryness; healthy intact skin is an important barrier. Report any dermatitis – staff with skin lesions on hands may need work re-assignment until healed.

Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and Standard Precautions:

Gloves: Wear gloves whenever contact with blood, body fluids, mucous membranes, non-intact skin, or potentially contaminated surfaces is anticipated (this is part of Standard Precautions)
cdc.gov
. Examples: drawing blood, handling urine containers, oral care, etc. Gloves are not a substitute for hand hygiene – perform hand hygiene before putting on gloves and immediately after removing them
cdc.gov
.

Mask & Eye Protection: Wear a surgical mask and eye protection (face shield or goggles) for procedures that may generate splashes/sprays of blood or fluids (e.g., suctioning, intubation). Also, anyone with respiratory symptoms should wear a mask to protect others (and staff should follow Respiratory Hygiene/Cough Etiquette).

Gowns: Wear a fluid-resistant gown to protect skin and clothing during procedures or patient-care activities where contact with blood/body fluids is likely (e.g., wound irrigation, central line insertion). Remove the gown and perform hand hygiene before leaving the patient’s environment.

Transmission-Based Precautions: In addition to Standard Precautions, use Contact, Droplet, or Airborne Precautions for patients known or suspected to have certain infectious diseases
cdc.gov
:

Contact Precautions: For infections spread by direct contact (e.g., MRSA, VRE, C. difficile). Requirements: private room if possible, gloves and gown upon room entry for all interactions involving patient or environment
cdc.gov
. Dispose of PPE before exiting. Use dedicated or disposable equipment (stethoscopes, BP cuff) for that patient
cdc.gov
. Limit patient transport; if needed, ensure infected areas are covered and caregivers use PPE during transport.

Droplet Precautions: For pathogens spread by large respiratory droplets (e.g., influenza, meningococcal meningitis, pertussis). Requires a surgical mask for anyone entering the room
cdc.gov
. The patient should be in a single room; if transport is necessary, patient wears a mask
cdc.gov
. Usual gloves and gown if performing tasks with secretion contact (which are standard precautions anyway).

Airborne Precautions: For infections spread through tiny airborne particles (e.g., tuberculosis, measles, varicella). Patient should be in an Airborne Infection Isolation Room (negative pressure room) with door closed
cdc.gov
. Staff must wear a fit-tested N95 respirator (or higher protection) when entering
cdc.gov
. Non-immune staff should not care for patients with measles or chickenpox if immune staff are available
cdc.gov
. Limit patient transport; patient wears a regular mask if must be moved
cdc.gov
.

Environmental Cleaning & Needle Safety:

All patient care areas should be kept clean. High-touch surfaces (bed rails, call buttons, doorknobs) in Contact Precaution rooms should be disinfected daily
cdc.gov
. Use EPA-registered hospital disinfectants. For C. diff rooms, use a sporicidal agent for cleaning.

Needles and sharps: Do not recap needles. Use safety-engineered devices whenever available. Dispose of all sharps in puncture-resistant sharps containers; never in regular trash. Immediately activate needle safety after use and dispose. Report any needlestick or blood exposure to Employee Health promptly (source patient testing and post-exposure prophylaxis may be needed).

Monitoring and Compliance:

The Infection Control team will conduct random hand hygiene audits (direct observation of hand cleaning opportunities met vs missed) and report compliance rates. Our goal is ≥90% hand hygiene compliance. Units with lower rates will receive additional education and re-auditing.

Audit results and HAI (healthcare-associated infection) rates are reviewed in Infection Control Committee. Positive reinforcement (like acknowledgment of high-performing units) and just-in-time coaching for individuals are used to improve compliance.

Enforcement: Repeated non-compliance with hand hygiene or PPE use can result in counseling and, if needed, disciplinary action, as it endangers patient safety.

By adhering to this policy – cleaning hands religiously and using PPE appropriately – we create a safer environment for patients and staff. “Clean Hands Save Lives,” and infection prevention is everyone’s responsibility.

10. Code Blue (Cardiac Arrest) Response Protocol

Purpose: Provide a structured plan for responding to adult cardiopulmonary arrests (“Code Blue”) within the hospital, ensuring timely, effective Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS). All clinical staff must be familiar with their role in a Code Blue to improve patient survival.

Activation of Code Blue:

Recognition of Arrest: If a patient is unresponsive, not breathing normally (or only gasping), and has no pulse, shout for help and initiate the Code Blue. Any staff member can call a code – don’t delay if cardiac arrest is suspected.

Calling the Code: Dial the emergency number (e.g., “#555”) or use the code button to alert the hospital operator with location. Announce “Code Blue, [Unit name/Room number].” Overhead paging will notify the Code Blue team to respond.

Begin CPR Immediately: The first responder starts high-quality CPR (Chest compressions at 100-120/min, at least 2 inches deep, full recoil, minimal interruptions). Early CPR is critical and should not wait for the code team
my.clevelandclinic.org
. If a second person is present, have them bring the nearest crash cart (with defibrillator) to the patient’s location.

Code Blue Team and Roles: Our hospital code team includes: ICU or ER physician (team leader), critical care or ED nurse, respiratory therapist, pharmacist, and a recorder, among others. They arrive with the crash cart and ACLS equipment.

Team Leader (MD or ACLS RN) – directs the code, makes treatment decisions, and ensures ACLS algorithms are followed.

Compressor – person assigned to do chest compressions, switching out every 2 minutes to avoid fatigue.

Airway Manager – usually RT or anesthesiology, manages airway and ventilation (bag-mask initially, then intubation when possible). Intubation should be done with minimal interruption to compressions (compressions paused only briefly for tube pass).

Defibrillator/Oxygen Nurse – operates the defibrillator (pads placement, charging, shocking when commanded) and manages IV access/med infusions. Attach the pads/monitor as soon as the cart arrives to determine rhythm
ahajournals.org
.

IV/Med Nurse – establishes IV or IO access if not already, prepares and pushes medications as ordered (e.g., epinephrine, amiodarone).

Recorder – documents the code events, including times of medication doses, shocks, return of pulse, etc.

All code responders should know how to perform CPR and use the defibrillator
my.clevelandclinic.org
, even if not a formal code team member – if you’re first on scene, start CPR and use the AED/defibrillator. The code team might take 3-5 minutes to arrive
my.clevelandclinic.org
, so early actions by initial responders are vital.

ACLS Algorithm in Code:

Rhythm Check & Defibrillation: As soon as the defibrillator/monitor is attached, determine if the rhythm is shockable (ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia) or non-shockable (asystole or pulseless electrical activity). If shockable, immediately deliver a shock and resume CPR for 2 minutes
ahajournals.org
. Early defibrillation combined with good CPR greatly increases survival in VF/VT arrests
ahajournals.org
. If non-shockable, focus on CPR and medications.

CPR Cycles: Perform CPR in 2-minute cycles. The compressor calls out when switching is needed. The team leader will call for a rhythm check every 2 minutes (but minimize pause in compressions – ideally <10 seconds for pulse/rhythm check).

Airway and Breathing: Maintain ventilation with a bag-mask at 100% O₂ (10 breaths/min, with continuous compressions). An advanced airway (endotracheal tube) should be placed by a skilled provider when feasible without excessive interruption. Once intubated, set a ventilation rate ~10 breaths/min and do not pause compressions for breaths.

Medications:

Epinephrine 1 mg IV/IO is given every 3-5 minutes during the arrest for all rhythms
cpr.heart.org
(usually start after the first shock in VF/VT, and immediately in asystole/PEA). Epinephrine helps improve chances of Return of Spontaneous Circulation (ROSC)
cpr.heart.org
.

For persistent VF/VT that is unresponsive to shocks + CPR, give Amiodarone 300 mg IV push after the 3rd shock (and a second dose of 150 mg for a refractory case). This antiarrhythmic can help terminate refractory VF
my.clevelandclinic.org
.

Treat reversible causes (Hs & Ts) as needed (e.g., give IV magnesium for Torsades de Pointes, fluid for hypovolemia, needle decompression for tension pneumothorax, etc., as directed by team leader).

Coordination: The code leader ensures all interventions occur in sequence – e.g., after 2 minutes CPR, “Pause – check rhythm.” If still VF, “Charging defibrillator, everyone clear – Shock.” Immediately, “Resume CPR.” Another team member is preparing the next epinephrine dose to give promptly when due. The scene can be hectic, but clear communication (closed-loop) and adherence to ACLS steps is emphasized.

Post-Resuscitation Care:

If ROSC is achieved (pulse and blood pressure return), transition to post-arrest care:

Airway/Breathing: Ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation. Many patients will be intubated by ROSC time. Target O₂ sat 92-98%, avoid hyperventilation (target ETCO₂ 35-45 mmHg).

Circulation: Manage blood pressure (consider IV fluids, vasopressors to maintain SBP >90 or MAP ≥65). Obtain a 12-lead ECG to look for STEMI (which might require emergent cath lab).

Targeted Temperature Management (TTM): For comatose patients after cardiac arrest, initiate TTM to 32-36°C per protocol to improve neurologic outcomes (if applicable in our facility).

ICU Transfer: The patient should be transferred to ICU for continued care. The code team will give a detailed handoff to ICU team.

If code efforts are unsuccessful after a reasonable duration (typically >20-30 minutes with no ROSC and no shockable rhythm or other signs of improvement), the code leader may decide to cease resuscitation after consulting attending physician and considering special circumstances.

Documentation and Debriefing:

The recorder or team leader will ensure a Code Blue report is completed in the medical record, including initial rhythm, times of meds/shocks, procedures, ROSC or time of death.

A debriefing with the code team is encouraged after each event to discuss what went well and any issues (equipment problems, etc.), as this can improve future performance.

Following this Code Blue protocol ensures a consistent, high-quality emergency response. Key aspects are immediate CPR, early defibrillation for shockable rhythms, timely epinephrine, and effective team coordination
my.clevelandclinic.org
cpr.heart.org
. Regular mock codes and ACLS certifications will reinforce these skills so that staff remain ready to act decisively when a real Code Blue occurs.
